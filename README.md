# Workshop-7

This is my first larger website, built with HTML and CSS using small icons, background images and other visual elements. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-7

## Overview

The project is a single-page multi-section layout that focuses on:

- Using icons and background images for visual structure :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Organising styles with a dedicated reset file and main stylesheet  
- Practising a bigger page structure compared to previous workshops

The site is fully static and runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Single-page website (`index.html`) with multiple content sections :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Custom design built with:
  - Small icon images
  - Background images for sections or the page
- Separated styles:
  - `reset.css` for resetting default browser styles
  - `style.css` for main layout and design :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Image assets stored under `Images/` (icons, backgrounds, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript, no backend)  
- Codebase is mostly CSS, with HTML markup for structure :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
