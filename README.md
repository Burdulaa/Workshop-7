# Workshop-6

Here I built a registration panel using HTML and CSS. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-6

## Overview

This project is a small single-page layout focused on creating a styled registration panel.  
It demonstrates how to:

- Structure a simple registration form in HTML
- Style a panel, inputs and button(s) with CSS
- Keep markup and styles in separate files (`index.html` and `style.css`). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

The page is fully static and runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Single-page static site (`index.html`) with a registration panel UI :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Form-style layout where a user would enter registration data (e.g. name, email, password)
- Custom styling for:
  - Panel/container
  - Text fields and labels
  - Primary action button (e.g. “Register” / “Sign up”)
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only, no JavaScript and no backend
- CSS is the main part of the project (most of the codebase is CSS). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
