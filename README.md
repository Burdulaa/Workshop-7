# Workshop-7

This is my first larger website project, where I experiment with a full-page layout using small icons, background images and more detailed styling with HTML and CSS.

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-7

## Overview

The goal of this workshop is to move from small single components to a complete multi-section page, focusing on:

- Structuring a larger layout (header, content blocks, footer, etc.)
- Using background images and icons for visual style
- Organizing styles across multiple CSS files (`reset.css` and `style.css`)
- Keeping the site fully static and running only in the browser

## Features

- Single main page: `index.html`
- Global CSS reset via `reset.css` to normalise browser defaults
- Custom styling in `style.css` (layout, colors, typography, backgrounds)
- Local image assets inside `Images/` (icons, background images, decorative graphics)
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript, no backend)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with a reset stylesheet)

## Getting Started

You only need a web browser.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-7.git

# Go into the project folder
cd Workshop-7
